        Just like that, my last few days of school are almost over. By the time
        of writing this, it is currently 1:55am, 27th of September, 2024, the
        day of my sister's wedding. I shouldn't be doing my digital but I had no
        choice as I am at Waiheke Island right now. No matter what grade I get,
        all that matters is that I finished my school year with a bang. Thank
        you to everyone who has had an impact on my school life, yes even the
        negative ones. Shout out Hashiriya Club and Akina Nation!
